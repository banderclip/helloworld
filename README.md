Hey there awesome coding community!
I'm an eccentric ensemble of brilliance. I am a web student and a 24/7 on call mom, plus a wife to an awesome tech man. I love coding because I love order making coding my happy place in an otherwise caotic mass of legos on the floor life (which I would not trade for a million codes btw). I do love aliterations in case you didn't see. And coffee. Oh! And cupcakes. I run on coffee and sunshine with a bit of sugar thrown in. The end.
